Code Generators
===============

BESSER offers a suite of code generators designed for diverse technologies and purposes. These generators play 
a pivotal role in translating your model, created using the :doc:`buml_language`, into executable code suitable for 
various applications, such as Django models or database structures compatible with SQLAlchemy.

Currently, BESSER covers the following range of predefined code generators (although you could also design your 
own generator).
