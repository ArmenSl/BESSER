Installation
=============

Basic Installation (coming soon)
--------------------------------
BESSER works with Pyhton 3.9+. We recommend creating a virtual environment (e.g. `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_, 
`conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_).

The latest stable version of BESSER is available in the Python Package Index (PyPi) and can be installed using

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install besser

Building From Source
--------------------
To obtain the full code, including examples and tests, you can clone the git repository.

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/BESSER.git

Once you have the code, install the necessary packages and libraries.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
