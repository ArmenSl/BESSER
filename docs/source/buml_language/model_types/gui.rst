GUI model
=========

it focuses on the specification of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and draws inspiration from the Interaction Flow 
Modeling Language (IFML), which is widely recognized and adopted in the field of UI modeling. By leveraging 
IFML, we ensure compatibility and interoperability with existing UI modeling tools and frameworks. This abstract 
syntax also enables the definition of GUI components that read and modify elements from a diversity of data sources, 
including B-UML model elements.
