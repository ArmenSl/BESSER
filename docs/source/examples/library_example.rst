Library
================

This example present the Python code of a basic model (designed with the :doc:`../buml_language`) that describes the typical 
domain of libraries, books and authors. The UML diagram is depicted in the following figure.

  :alt: Library model
  :align: center

And the Python code to specify the model, including its classes, attributes, and relationships, is as follows.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../tests/library_test/library.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:

.. note::
    
    A B-UML model can also be created :doc:`from a model designed with PlantUML <../buml_language/plantuml>` or even 
    :doc:`from an image <../buml_language/image_to_buml>`.
