Library
================

This example present the Python code of a basic model (designed with the :doc:`../buml_language`) that describes the typical 
domain of libraries, books and authors. The UML diagram is depicted in the following figure.

And the Python code to specify the model, including its classes, attributes, and relationships, is as follows.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/library/library.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:

.. note::
    
    A B-UML model can also be created from a model designed with PlantUML. You can get more information 
    :doc:`here <../buml_language/plantuml>`.
