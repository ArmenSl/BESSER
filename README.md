# BESSER

BESSER is a [low-modeling](https://modeling-languages.com/welcome-to-the-low-modeling-revolution/) [low-code](https://modeling-languages.com/low-code-vs-model-driven/) open-source platform. BESSER (Building bEtter Smart Software fastER) is funded thanks to an [FNR Pearl grant](https://modeling-languages.com/a-smart-low-code-platform-for-smart-software-in-luxembourg-goodbye-barcelona/) led by the [Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.list.lu/) with the participation of the [Snt/University of Luxembourg](https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/) and open to all your contributions!

The BESSER low-code platform is built on top of our Python-based personal interpretation of a "Universal Modeling Language" (yes, heavily inspired and a simplified version of the better known UML, the Unified Modeling Language) 

## Installation

The requirements to install BESSER UML are:

* Python 3.10.11 or later
* *setuptools* 65.5.0 or later

You can download and install Python from [the website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then, you can install *setuptools* by running the following command:

    pip install setuptools

Download the latest release of the project [here](https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/BESSER-UML/releases/latest), and install BESSER UML (buml) in your environment by executing the following command (using the wheels package):

    pip install buml-x.x.x-py3-none-any.whl

**Note:** replace *x.x.x* with version number

## BUML Documentation

* [BUML modeling](https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/BESSER-UML/blob/master/docs/metamodel-doc.md): to model a problem, system, domain, or anything else.

* [BUML PlantUML notation](https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/BESSER-UML/blob/master/docs/plantuml-doc.md): to use the [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) notation to generate a BUML model.
